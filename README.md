Oh hi! Iâ€™m Joe, a self taught coder working at [Arcadia](https://www.arcadia.com/) as a Senior Software Engineer. Every time you refresh my profile, you'll get a new rendering of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). No seriously, there are thousand unique game of life simulations that you can randomly get!
