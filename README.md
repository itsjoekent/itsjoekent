Oh hi! Iâ€™m Joe, a self taught coder working at [Arcadia](https://www.arcadia.com/) as a Senior Software Engineer. Every time you refresh my profile, you'll get a new [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulation. No seriously, there are _ten thousand_ unique game of life simulations that you can randomly get!
